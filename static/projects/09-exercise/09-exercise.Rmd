# Task 1: Reflection

Put your reflection here


# Task 2: Annotations

```{r load-libraries-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Load data here
```

Do the following:

1. Make a plot. Any kind of plot will do (though it might be easiest to work with `geom_point()`).

2. Label (some or all of) the points using one of `geom_text()`, `geom_label()`, `geom_text_repel()`, or `geom_label_repel()`. You might need to make a new indicator variable so that you only highlight a few of the points instead of all of them.

3. Add *at least two each** the following annotations somewhere on the plot using `annotate()`:

    - **Text**
    - **An arrow** (make a curved arrow for bonus fun)
    - **A rectangle**
    
    You can add more if you want, but those three are the minimum. Try to incorporate the annotations into the design of the plot rather than just placing them wherever.

Good luck and have fun!
