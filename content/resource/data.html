<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural"><strong>Data is Plural newsletter</strong></a>: Jeremy Singer-Vine sends a weekly newsletter of the most interesting public datasets he’s found. You should subscribe to it. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0">He also has an archive of all the datasets he’s highlighted.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch"><strong>Google Dataset Search</strong></a>: Google indexes thousands of public datasets; search for them here.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets"><strong>Kaggle</strong></a>: Kaggle hosts machine learning competitions where people compete to create the fastest, most efficient, most predictive algorithms. A byproduct of these competitions is a host of fascinating datasets that are generally free and open to the public. See, for example, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">the European Soccer Database</a>, the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/salem-witchcraft-dataset">Salem Witchcraft Dataset</a> or results from an <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/oreo-flavors-tastetest-ratings">Oreo flavors taste test</a>.</p></li>
