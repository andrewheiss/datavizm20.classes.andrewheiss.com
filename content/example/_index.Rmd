This section contains fully annotated R code that you can use as a reference for creating your own visualizations. In the lessons section, you sequentially build up your understanding of R and **ggplot2**; here you can see how all the pieces work together. 

Visit this section after you have finished the readings, lecture videos, and lesson. The examples here will be indispensable for you as you work on your assignments and mini projects.

Each section also contains videos of me live coding the examples so you can see what it looks like to work with R in real time. You'll notice me make all sorts of little errors, which *is totally normal*—everyone does!
