- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> [Sparkline theory and practice](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR). This is a collection of posts by Edward Tufte about sparklines—scroll down a ways and check out his examples, analysis, and critiques.
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> [Time series sparklines](https://flowingdata.com/2017/01/24/one-dataset-visualized-25-ways/02-time-series-sparklines-2/)
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> [The bullet graph](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2017/5/25/the-bullet-graph)
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> [Lollipop charts](https://uc-r.github.io/lollipop). If you're feeling adventurous (and you should!), do this tutorial as you read it.

### Questions to reflect on

- These readings all show a ton of new ways to present comparisons. Which ones are your favorite? Which ones didn't quite click with you? In what situations are some more appropriate than others?
- Do bullet graphs break the rule against double y-axes? Why or why not?
