There's no lesson for this session. In your exercise today you'll visualize text data using [**tidytext**](https://www.tidytextmining.com/), and the best way to figure that out is to just play with data.

So head over to [the example](/example/13-example/) to see how it's done, or [the exercise](/assignment/13-exercise/) to get started!
