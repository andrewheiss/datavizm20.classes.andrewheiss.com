Ha, so in the video I said there would be interactive lessons, but *I changed my mind!* You're only working with a few new functions this session (`annotate()`, `geom_text()`, `geom_label()`, `geom_text_repel()`, and `geom_label_repel()`), and the best way to figure out how to use them is to use them!

There are some helpful blog posts and other resources online with examples and explanations. Read through these in addition to the documentation for [`annotate()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/annotate.html), [`geom_text()/geom_label()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_text.html) and [**ggrepel**]()https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggrepel/vignettes/ggrepel.html:
